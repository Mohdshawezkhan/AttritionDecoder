ðŸ“Š Key Findings

Gender Disparity: Males exhibit a higher attrition rate compared to females, hinting at potential disparities in job satisfaction, career opportunities, and workplace environment.

Age Dynamics: Attrition rates vary across different age groups, with individuals between 28-32 experiencing the highest attrition. This trend declines with advancing age, indicating a shift towards job stability and long-term commitments as individuals progress in their careers.

Income Levels: Attrition rates are influenced by income levels, with significant spikes observed at very low income levels and a gradual decrease as income rises. This underscores the importance of financial stability in employee retention.

Job Satisfaction: Lower levels of job satisfaction correlate with higher attrition rates, particularly among employees with average monthly salaries of 4596. Conversely, higher satisfaction levels, especially among those earning 6853, contribute to employee retention.

Departmental Differences: The Sales department exhibits the highest attrition rate, followed by Human Resources, while Research and Development demonstrate lower rates. This suggests variations in work culture, opportunities, and satisfaction levels across departments.

Job Role Impact: Higher-level job roles show lower attrition rates compared to lower-level roles, indicating the importance of career advancement opportunities and job stability in retaining talent.

Salary Increment Influence: Enhanced salary increments serve as a significant incentive for retention, motivating employees to perform better and remain committed to the organization.

Educational Background: Individuals with higher education levels, such as master's and doctorate degrees, demonstrate lower attrition rates, highlighting the value of specialized skills and advanced qualifications in job satisfaction and retention.

Salary and Stock Options: Salary and stock options serve as significant motivators for employees, leading to higher loyalty and reduced attrition rates. Employees who receive higher pay and more stock options are more likely to remain committed to their organization, highlighting the importance of competitive compensation packages in retaining talent.

Work-Life Balance: Work-life balance emerges as a crucial factor influencing employee motivation and retention. While a good work-life balance is often considered a motivation factor, it can also lead employees to seek better opportunities and a higher standard of living elsewhere. Balancing work demands with personal life priorities is essential for maintaining employee satisfaction and reducing turnover.
